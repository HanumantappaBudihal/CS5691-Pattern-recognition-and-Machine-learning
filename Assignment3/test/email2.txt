Dear Students,

As you are aware, there have a been instances of positive cases in campus. 

It is important, as well as urgent, to prevent the spread.

I strongly urge you to use masks at all places both inside as well as outside the classroom, anywhere in campus as well as outside the campus.

Please stay safe. This is important for your health, which is the deciding factor in enabling any activity.
